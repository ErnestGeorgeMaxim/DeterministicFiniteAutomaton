# Deterministic Finite Automaton

## Overview
This project provides a robust and flexible library for working with Deterministic Finite Automaton in Java. A DFA is a mathematical model used to recognize and validate strings based on a predefined set of states and transition rules.

## Features
- Create custom DFAs with configurable states and transitions
- Validate input strings against a DFA
- Visualize DFA structure and transitions
- Support for different acceptance criteria (e.g., accepting on final state, rejecting on final state)
- Comprehensive error handling and input validation
